# QonQrete Terminology

**Version:** `v0.3.0-alpha` (See `VERSION` file for the canonical version).

This document defines the official vocabulary for the QonQrete Secure AI Construction Loop System.

### Core Components & Roles
- **Qrane**: The host‑layer orchestrator (`qrane/qrane.py`) that runs outside the sandbox. It manages the `Qage` lifecycle and the CLI.
- **worQer**: An AI agent that performs a specific role.
- **instruQtor**: Agent 1, the Planner. A `gpt-4o` based agent that creates a high-level plan.
- **construQtor**: Agent 2, the Executor. A `gemini-2.5-pro` based agent that executes the plan, writing code and files.
- **inspeQtor**: Agent 3, the Reviewer. A `gpt-4o` based agent that reviews the work of the `construQtor`.
- **Qrew**: The collection of agents that work together inside the `Qage`.

### Environment & Structure
- **Qage**: The secure Docker container that contains the `Qrew` and their runtime environment.
- **Qodeyard**: The output directory (`.../qodeyard/`) where all code and artifacts are generated by the `construQtor`.
- **worQspace**: The shared volume (`worqspace/`) that acts as the filesystem bridge between the `Qrane` and the `Qage`.

### Workflow & Data
- **cyQle**: A full Plan -> Execute -> Review loop.
- **tasQ**: The initial, high-level user request (`worqspace/tasq.md`). For subsequent cycles, this is the user-modified `reQap`.
- **briQ**: A single, atomic step of the plan, generated by the `instruQtor` and stored as a markdown file in `.../briq.d/`.
- **exeQ**: The execution summary generated by the `construQtor` after it runs, stored in `.../exeq.d/`.
- **reQap**: The final markdown review from the `inspeQtor`, stored in `.../reqap.d/`. This file is human-editable.

### User Interaction
- **gateQeeper**: The human user responsible for making decisions at the "CheQpoint".
- **CheQpoint**: The mandatory pause in a `cyQle` after the `reQap` is displayed.
- **Qontinue**: The CLI command (`q`) to approve the `reQap` and proceed to the next cycle.
- **tweaQ**: The CLI command (`t`) to pause the `cyQle` and open the `reQap` in your default editor (`$EDITOR`).
- **Quit**: The CLI command (`x`) to gracefully end the QonQrete session.
- **breaQ**: A `Ctrl+C` interrupt to forcibly terminate the session.
- **Qommander**: In TUI mode, the top panel where the user provides input.
- **Qonsole**: In TUI mode, the bottom panel that displays real-time log output from the agents.
