# QonQrete - Secure AI Construction Loop System

QonQrete is a multi-agent orchestration system designed for secure, observable, and human-in-the-loop software construction. It operates on the principle of a secure build environment (`Qage`), managed by a host-level orchestrator (`Qrane`).

This architecture ensures that AI-generated code and processes cannot affect the host system, providing a robust framework for autonomous and semi-autonomous development.

## Version

**Version:** `v0.1.0` (See `VERSION` file for the canonical version).

## Core Principles

1.  **Isolation by Design**: All agent execution occurs within the `Qage`, a Docker container that acts as a secure sandbox. The `Qrane`, running on the host, manages the workflow.
2.  **Configuration-Driven**: The agent models and cycle limits are defined declaratively in `worqspace/config.yaml`.
3.  **File-Based Communication**: Agents communicate by reading and writing markdown files to a shared `worqspace/` volume, creating a transparent and auditable "chat history".
4.  **Human‑in‑the‑Loop Control**: A non‑negotiable **CheQpoint** pauses the system after each `cyQle`. The user, acting as the `gateQeeper`, must review the results and provide explicit instructions to **[Q]ontinue**, **[T]weaQ**, or **[X]Quit**.

## Architecture Overview

-   `qrane/`: Contains the Python-based **Qrane** orchestrator and its command-line interface.
-   `worqer/`: Contains the individual AI agent scripts (`instruQtor`, `construQtor`, `inspeQtor`).
-   `worqspace/`: The shared data plane. It contains all configuration, the initial `tasQ`, and all generated plans (`briQ`), summaries (`exeQ`), and reviews (`reQap`).

## The Workflow CyQle

A `cyQle` consists of three main phases, orchestrated by the `Qrane`:

1.  **Plan (`instruQtor`)**: A `gpt-4o` agent reads the high-level `tasQ` and creates a series of markdown `briQ` files, which contain a detailed, high-level plan for the executor agent.
2.  **Execute (`construQtor`)**: A `gemini-2.5-pro` agent is invoked for each `briQ`. It reads the high-level plan and uses its own powerful agency and tools to generate all necessary files and code in the `qodeyard/` directory.
3.  **Review (`inspeQtor`)**: A `gpt-4o` agent reviews the code generated by the `construQtor`, assesses its quality, and produces a final `reQap` (review) with an assessment and suggestions for the next cycle.
4.  **CheQpoint (`gateQeeper`)**: The `Qrane` pauses the system and displays the `reQap`, waiting for the user's command to proceed.

## Getting Started

For a full guide on setting up the environment and running your first `cyQle`, please see **[QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)**.

The primary command to run the system is:
```bash
./qonqrete.sh run
```
